                <h5 id="h5">Hi! I'm glad <span style="color: rgb(245, 105, 105); font-style: italic;">you</span> made it. Here's a little about <span style="color: rgb(245, 105, 105); font-style: italic;">me</span>:</h5>

                <p><br>I spent 2 years in the U.S. Navy as an IT on a submarine. I was unfortunately discharged(Honorably) in June of 2021 due to 
                    <br> medical complications that wouldn't allow me to be on a submarine anymore, according to the Navy's standards.
                </p>

                <p>I trained in communications and then merged with IT so I got to train in IT as well. 
                    <br> I strongly value the time I spent in the Navy. Everything has to be perfect in the military therefore you're expected to be perfect. 
                    <br> While we know not everyone is perfect, the life skills and lessons I gained got me a whole lot closer. 
                </p>

                <p>These skills have stayed with me since transitioning out of the military and help me in my every day life. The biggest being how to handle 
                    <br> stressful situations. Being on a submarine was one of the most stressful things I could have ever imagined and learning to stay composed, 
                    <br> calm, and collected while getting my work done was paramount for success. 
                </p>

                <h5><br>Why I chose software engineering</h5>

                <p><br>The Navy was really my first experience being in the tech world and I loved it. The rigorous classroom technical training
                    <br> was fascinating to me. I even got to code some while training! Once I got out of the Navy I knew I wanted to stay in the tech industry 
                    <br> and wanted to get in it as fast as I could. <br>
                    <br>That being said, I decided to enroll in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through the University of Texas at Austin.
                    <br>What a ride that was! It was intense and fast-paced and I got to learn way more than I could have imagined I would.
                    <br><br>If you made it this far, my goal is to bring you, (hopefully) my future employer, the best version of myself. 
                    <br>All of my experience and skills gained from the U.S. Navy, and all of my recently gained software developer skills, could all be yours.
